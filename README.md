## Physical Computing (IGME 470) Project 3: Squawk
## Goal: Create a compelling, coherent experience that centers an everyday object/s turns it into an "activated object" using audio and WiFi or serial.
### Incorporate: 
-	a speaker and/or a mic or substitute some more "interesting" audio widget or app for either. 
-	Your activated object (via Arduino) talks meaningfully with another device. 
  -	Maybe an app or 2nd Arduino listens to translate data from a mic 
  -	Sensors mounted on/in your object translate data into pixels, audio, tweets, and/or movement. 
  -	Maybe your Arduino listens to a data feed from a website to make your object purr/buzz and wiggle in response.
  
The Nano and breadboard should be hidden or tucked under cover so that interactions with the object are the focus. The embedding or attachment of sensors/actuators on the object should be competently crafted.

### Your blog post (appropriate for general audiences) should include:
-	statement of experience goal
-	summary descriptive text
-	narrative, issues, discoveries, results
-	Process & result photos and video/s. Any video (with title and credits) should be linked and embedded in the blog post.
-	code or link to code
-	circuit diagram/schematic
-	citation/s of any inspired-by work and clutch technical references

## Our Project
### Materials:
- cardboard
- felt
- stuffing
- speaker
- keyboard

### The Plan:
- Keyboard creates unique sound for each of 8 keys hit, pitching up or down with the arrow keys
- Transmits to a speaker contained in an object that looks like a little creature
- Use two motors to wiggle the arms of the creature as it sings
